# Description

This is a very basic implementation of a static website with backend and postgres database implemented as Docker containers
and connected via a bridge network. 

This is just an example, and websites implemented in other frameworks can also be created. 

If you have docker installed, open the repository directory, and run `docker compose up -d`.
Next, visit `http://localhost` to see the website.
